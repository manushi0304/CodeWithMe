#### 1. Get Code Feedback

```python
from code_evaluator import evaluate_code

code = """
def two_sum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
"""

feedback = evaluate_code(code, language="python")
print(feedback)
```

from security_scanner import scan_code

code = """
import os
password = "hardcoded_password"
eval(user_input)
"""

vulnerabilities = scan_code(code)
for issue in vulnerabilities:
    print(f"⚠️ {issue['severity']}: {issue['description']}")
```
